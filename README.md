# actions_test_repo
Test for some GitHub actions setup.

Basically, I'd like to do the following whenever I commit to 
https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/snakemake-novice-bioinformatics

1) Install conda environment based upon the latest episodes/files/conda_env.yaml
2) Download the tutorial data (if I can do that??)
3) Do the renaming bit
4) Run the ep07 workflow
5) Check the MultiQC report gets created

(maybe repeat the same for conda_env_min.yaml?)

And I want to be able to get this working without a load of commits to the lesson repo, hence why I'm
setting it up here in thsi test repo.
